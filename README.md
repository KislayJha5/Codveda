Level 1 (Basic)- Task 1: Data Collection and Web Scraping  Task 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis  Level 2 - (Intermediate) including 3 task and Level 3 (Advanced) also Including 3 task.
LEVEL 1 (BASIC) - Project: Analyzing Book Prices and Ratings
Our goal is to scrape data from the website books.toscrape.com, a sandbox for web scrapers. We will collect book titles, prices, and ratings, clean this data, and then perform an exploratory analysis to find insights.
LEVEL 2 (INTERMEDIATE) - Task 1: Predictive Modeling (Regression)
In this task, we will build a model to predict a continuous value. We'll use the California Housing dataset, which is readily available in scikit-learn. The goal is to predict the median house value for California districts.
Task 2: Classification with Logistic Regression
For this task, we will build a classifier to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. We'll use the classic Iris dataset.
Task 3: Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
In this task, we will perform K-Means clustering. Since this is unsupervised learning, we don't use labels. We'll generate synthetic data to clearly visualize the clusters and use the "elbow method" and "silhouette score" to find the optimal number of clusters.
LEVEL 3 (ADVANCED) -  Task 1: Time Series Analysis
This task focuses on analyzing data points collected over time to forecast future trends. We will use a synthetic dataset that mimics typical sales data with a clear trend and seasonality.

Conceptual Overview
Decomposition: This technique separates a time series into three components:

Trend: The underlying long-term direction of the data (e.g., increasing or decreasing).

Seasonality: A repeating, predictable pattern over a fixed period (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly).

Residual: The random, irregular noise left over after removing the trend and seasonality.

Moving Average (MA): A simple smoothing technique that calculates the average of a certain number of past data points to identify the trend.

Exponential Smoothing: A more advanced smoothing method where more weight is given to recent observations, making it more responsive to recent changes. Holt-Winters is an extension that can capture both trend and seasonality.

SARIMA: Stands for Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It's a powerful model for forecasting time series data that exhibits seasonality.

ARIMA(p,d,q):

p: Order of the AutoRegressive (AR) part.

d: Degree of differencing required to make the series stationary (Integrated - I).

q: Order of the Moving Average (MA) part.

SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q) 
m
â€‹
 : Includes additional seasonal components (P,D,Q) where 'm' is the number of time steps in a seasonal period (e.g., 12 for monthly data).
 Task 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text Classification
This task involves training a model to classify text. A classic example is a spam filter, which classifies emails as "spam" or "not spam" (ham).

Conceptual Overview
Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw text data for the model.

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or "tokens".

Stopword Removal: Removing common words (like "the", "a", "is") that don't carry much meaning.

Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" -> "run"). Lemmatization is generally preferred as it results in actual words.

Vectorization (TF-IDF): Machine learning models require numerical input. We convert text into numbers using techniques like TF-IDF.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection. It increases with the number of times a word appears in a document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.

Classification Model (Naive Bayes): A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It's simple, fast, and works surprisingly well for text classification tasks.
Task 3: Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras
This task involves building a simple feed-forward neural network to classify images from the famous MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digits (0-9).

Conceptual Overview
Neural Network: A model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

Input Layer: Receives the initial data.

Hidden Layers: Perform computations and feature extraction.

Output Layer: Produces the final prediction.

Preprocessing for Images:

Flattening: Converting a 2D image matrix into a 1D vector.

Normalization: Scaling pixel values (usually 0-255) to a smaller range (like 0-1) to help the model train faster and more stably.

One-Hot Encoding: Converting integer labels (e.g., 5) into a binary vector (e.g., [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]).

Training:

Backpropagation: The algorithm used to adjust the network's weights based on the error in its predictions.

Loss Function: Measures how inaccurate the model's predictions are (e.g., categorical_crossentropy).

Optimizer: An algorithm that adjusts the weights to minimize the loss (e.g., Adam).

Hyperparameters: Settings that are configured before training, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Tuning these is key to good performance.
